# Coding-Quiz

##Description

A simple timed quiz on basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript principles. 

My motivation behind this quiz was to understand using bootstrap to style as well as understanding setting up a timer and using event listeners. 
Also a good practice for setting up any kind of timed quiz/test to apply to future applications.
